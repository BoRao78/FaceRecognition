%
%    Description
%
%       mckNN_train takes,
%           train_fea        - An NxD matrix, the feature of training data. N is the number of training data and D is the dimension. Each row is an instance.
%           train_label      - A Nx1 array, each element train_label(i) indicating the label of i-th training sample. train_label(i) == 0 means 'out-group' person, otherwise 'in-group' person.
%           options          - The struct of mckNN training setting, where 
%             .k             - The number of neighbors selected
%             .s             - Laplacian correction, default 1
%
%      and returns,
%           likehood         - An CxC matrix, where C is the number of classes. Each element likehood(i+1,j+1) indicates the probability of an instance from the i-th class be one of the k nearest neighbors of the instance from the j-th class.
%           prior            - A Cx1 array. Each element prior(i+1) indicates prior probability of the i-th class.

% Rows of X correspond to observations, and columns correspond to variables. 
% D is a row vector of length m(mC1)/2,corresponding to pairs of observations in X. 
% The distances are arranged in the order (2,1), (3,1), ..., (m,1),(3,2), ..., (m,2), ..., (m,mC1)).
% D iscommonly used as a dissimilarity matrix in clustering or multidimensionalscaling
